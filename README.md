# Super Gaussian Model

A Super Gaussian is a top-flattened gaussian distribution.

On a single dimension you can define a range (A, B). All this region from A to B will be flattened and valuing at 100% and will decrease immediately after.

This figure shows a test on 1 dimension.

The following shows a test on 3 dimensions looking at several slices of the 3rd dimension.

This is a work in progress.

TODO:
- How to control the N-Dimensional rectangle to be 100 % within the defined limits.
- How to control the length of the tail
- How to control the speed at which the probability decreases
